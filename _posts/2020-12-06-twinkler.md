Why not [**take a look**](https://twinkler.herokuapp.com)?

I hit some more dumb inspiration today and made a silly toy to make source code twinkle.

It uses [pygments](https://pygments.org/) to parse uploaded code, and the colours are from emacs' [https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/themes/wombat-theme.el](wombat) theme.

Also, [Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a surprisingly simple platform for deploying a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) app.
