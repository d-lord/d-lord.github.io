Why not [**take a look**](http://twinkler.herokuapp.com)?

I hit some more dumb inspiration today and made a silly toy to make source code twinkle.

It uses [pygments](https://pygments.org/) to parse uploaded code, and the colours are from emacs' [wombat](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/themes/wombat-theme.el) theme.

Pygments will try to auto-detect which language you're using, but it doesn't always get it right. Things like a Python `import` statement tend to help. As this is effectively a shiny, hosted wrapper around pygments, made with a limited time budget, I'm not likely to improve that - wouldn't know where to start, except maybe a dropdown to hint which language you're using!

Also, [Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a surprisingly wonderful platform for deploying a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) app.
