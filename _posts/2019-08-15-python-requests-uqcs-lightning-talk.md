In August of 2018, I joined the [UQ Computing Society](https://uqcs.org.au)'s session of Python lightning talks to introduce the Requests library.

[Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is a very widely-used tool for making HTTP requests, which are useful in many contexts: to name a few, API consumption, web scraping, and inter-process communication.

As the audience was a student society, I did my best to teach an introduction to HTTP (the HyperText Transfer Protocol) while showing how it can be done in Requests. A tall order for five minutes, but I think it worked.

Take a look at the slides! They're available as [PowerPoint](/assets/other/2019-08-15-lightning_talk.pptx) or [PDF](/assets/other/2019-08-15-lightning_talk.pdf).
