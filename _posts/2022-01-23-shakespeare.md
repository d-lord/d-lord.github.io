Had a bit of a thought last night after a glass of whiskey and decided it ought to be shared with the world. What better way to practice my own writing than to constrain it to 280 characters?

I'm pretty happy with this. It was all written off the cuff, tweet by tweet, and incorporates enough references of my own to add some spice. _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, pixie folklore, spice trade, Brisbane's expo, Newton into Ozymandias, Yu-Gi-Oh. It's scattered but, I dunno, I like that breadth.

However... it's also, in the cold light of day, a bit ruder than I'm proud of. This is hard to quantify - it's fun that way, but the internet has enough flame wars, you know?
