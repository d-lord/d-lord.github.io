"If I screw this up," I said to Char, "I want it on video."

Our AirBnB host had assured us that the road was only *slightly* flooded, and we'd also discovered that the only other way there would see us ride in the dark - it needed another 40 minutes on an unsealed road, while watching nervously for kangaroos quite literally jumping out at us.

So: time to try to ford it.

{% comment %} <p> gives it the same margin-bottom as the text. Otherwise (in this theme) it's not the same. This feels more reusable than adding a specific video { margin: <the same as p> } rule.  {% endcomment %}

Great trip, even if I wished my bike was actually the [BMW GS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_GS) it dresses up as. We went from Brisbane to Warwick to stay up and watch the [Geminid Meteor Shower](https://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2021/12/geminid-meteor-shower-13-15-december.html) with dark skies. Didn't try for any pics of that though!

## Postscript

Dad dug up a photo from my childhood, probably the one time they let me ride a quad bike, adding "You used not to be so careful..."

Maybe that's why it was the only time. ðŸ¤”
