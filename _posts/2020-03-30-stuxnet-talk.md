In short, Stuxnet was a computer worm which notably damaged the Iranian nuclear facility known as Natanz. This talk covers the scientific and engineering background of the system that the worm disrupted.

I see a lot of infosec talks which dive into the bits and bytes of a specific attack, and they're great for sharpening your skills, but I think there's a really under-served market for *context and history*. That's what this talk is for: it was inspired by a conversation on the UQ shuttle with my manager, when we were talking about Stuxnet, and I said "what _is_ a centrifuge, anyway?". Neither of us really knew, so I did a quick dive into the science, engineering and supply chains, and then a couple of days later, Mandy asked for a talk for the AISA end of year event :)

This is a talk which I first gave for the [Australian Information Security Association](https://aisa.org.au/Public/Public/Branches/Brisbane/Brisbane_Branch.aspx) in December 2019, but wasn't recorded. I gave an extended version for UQCS with less assumed knowledge in March 2020, and here's the recording.

The talk itself starts at 10:50 and goes into question time around 44:45. Question time was pretty awkward with the delay, so maybe skip it this time around.

As usual in these times, it was originally planned as an in-person talk and then hastily amended to an online format!
