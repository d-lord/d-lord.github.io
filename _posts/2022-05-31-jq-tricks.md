Learned a few things today, thought I'd post them online as code snippets.

I was using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to manage some infrastructure, and some resource was giving me grief - breaking the program and giving an unbeatably vague error message when I tried to do a plan involving it. Unfortunately the TF state file was over a thousand lines, and so it was hard to track down the resource in question. It was hard to isolate individual resources in such a big file.

Each domain name creates four kinds of resources from each zone, so that meant working with four separate arrays in the JSON.[^1] So: I needed to manipulate the 4 kinds of resources created from each zone, directly in tfstate, and remove everything except the broken part to _know_ what's causing the problem.

Given a tfstate file like:

```json
{"resources": [
  {something boring},
  {"name": "parking_dkim",
   "instances": [
      {"index_key": "lord.geek.nz", ...},
      {"index_key": "dal-corp.com", ...},
      ... lots more instances here
    ]},
  {"name": "parking_dmarc",
    "instances": [
       {"index_key": "lord.geek.nz", ...},
       {"index_key": "dal-corp.com", ...},
      ... lots more instances here
     ]}
}
```

Back up the original file:
```sh
cp prod.tfvars prod_full.tfvars
```
and then run the following examples like this:
```sh
jq -f example.jq < prod_full.tfvars > prod.tfvars
```

**Let's get into it**.

Filter members of the resources array by whether their index_key has one of the zones you want:

```jq
["lord.geek.nz", "dal-corp.com", "angry.nerds"] as $targets |
.resources[1,2,3,4].instances |= map(select([.index_key] | inside($targets))) |
```

Make your own functions for a binary search by chaining these (simple version):

```jq
def right_half(addr):
  del(addr[0:(addr|length)/2]);
def left_half(addr):
  del(
    addr[
      ((addr|length)/2 | floor) : ]
  );

[range(1; 18)] |
right_half(.) |
left_half(.)
```
The example starts with the array [1..18], then takes the right half. It slices that up and takes the left half of what's left, returning [10, 11, 12, 13].

With these functions in hand, you can apply them to do your own binary search in tfstate. Narrow down and see what's breaking it. Try modifying the state by removing half of it, then run Terraform again, and see if it breaks:

```jq
def right_half(addr):
  del(addr.instances[0:(addr.instances|length)/2]);
def left_half(addr):
  del(
    addr.instances[
      ((addr.instances|length)/2 | floor) : ]
  );

left_half(.resources[1,2,3,4])
```

If that works fine (no error), try the right half instead:
```jq
# declarations as above
right_half(.resources[1,2,3,4])
```

Say that showed the error, then you'd subdivide it:
```jq
# declarations as above
right_half(.resources[1,2,3,4]) |
left_half(.resources[1,2,3,4])
```

If that shows the error, great, add another `| left_half` to keep narrowing it down. If not, try `| right_half` again. Keep doing this until you've found one set of resources corresponding to one domain. Tada, you've done it.

This is not the best explanation I can write (promise!) but I hope these code samples come in handy for you.

[^1]: Hashicorp [discourage you from treating it as JSON](https://www.terraform.io/language/state), but if I respected warning labels, I wouldn't have eaten all those paint chips as a kid. Lead is an all-natural sweetener and sometimes you've just gotta hack some state.
