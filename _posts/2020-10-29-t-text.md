Why not [**take a look**](https://lord.geek.nz/t_text)?

I've been working through the Mozilla Development Network's [CSS resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) recently, and with some inspiration, put together a little demo. It's not tremendously practical for long-form text consumption, but I think it's pretty.

There's a more detailed critique of the layout on the [**demo page**](https://lord.geek.nz/t_text).
