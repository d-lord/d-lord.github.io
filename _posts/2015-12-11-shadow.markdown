I was playing around in Javascript and wound up making a toy called [Shadow][shadow-static-link]. It's written in pure JS with HTML5 canvas, no need for jQuery.

I'm wary of jQuery. For all that my [Vim config is loaded with plugins][vim-config], I don't like creating unnecessary dependencies in a project. A lot of webdev questions on StackOverflow seem to assume it's necessary or the fundamental programming language, particularly [this example on how to *redirect a page*][so-redirect-question].

When I posted this to Facebook, I wound up using their developer interface to set custom attributes that would be displayed in the post. It winds up in OpenGraph `og:` properties in the header. [The interface is pretty neat][facebook-dev-shadow].

Here's the screenshot used in the Facebook link.

Also, [Anthony over at warywolf][stealdalsstuff] took the code and made it his own with a Windows 95-style animation.
