Lying in bed at night:

>Aagh, I don't know what I'm going to do about X.

During the day, when I'm free to get on with it:

>I wonder how cats' whiskers work.

Sitting down to practice mindfulness:

>I need to read this tomorrow, and ping Will about that, and I don't know how I'm going to do the other...

Can we reorganise these a bit?
