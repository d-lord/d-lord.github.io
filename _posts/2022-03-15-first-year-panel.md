The [UQ Computing Society](https://uqcs.org) run a regular panel called **Things I Wish I Knew In First Year**. I joined the party this time, and given it'd been six years since I graduated, I finally had some useful perspective.

It was a lot of fun! Heaps of questions from the floor. Plus, there was a plush shark on my lap the whole time. #blahajlyfe ![Emoji of a soft shark](/assets/images/blobhaj.webp)
