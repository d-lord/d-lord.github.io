Hi, I'm moving to the Gold Coast.


## About me

I'm 23, from New Zealand, and I've been in Brisbane for the last four years.
I studied computer science at [UQ](http://www.uq.edu.au).
I have a lovely girlfriend in Brisbane but she won't be coming with me, so I'll be visiting her on weekends.

I'm starting a graduate position at IBM in **Southport** on **8 February 2016**. Moving **mid-January** would be great.

### Interests
* I like reading, history, music, and video games.
* I've been playing a lot of Hearthstone and Team Fortress 2 lately, with some Kerbal Space Program thrown in.
* I used to have a car - pretty keen on driving.
* It's getting a bit warm for cycling, but in the cooler months I like my bike.
* A lot of computer stuff, of course. Building infrastructure, parsing text, Vim.
* Looking forward to living near the beach!

## Where?
Somewhere near the north end of Southport - that's where the office is, and I like walking to work.

## What kind of place?
I'm looking to spend about $200/wk. Could be part of a share house, could be an apartment or townhouse. I don't need a ton of space, but quiet is good.

Two, maybe three people total.

I've never lived in an apartment before, that could be fun...

Here's a few places:

* [This 2-bedroom apartment would be perfect, but it'll go too soon](http://www.realestate.com.au/property-unit-qld-southport-416747053)
* [This 2-bedroom unit looks great](http://www.realestate.com.au/property-unit-qld-southport-416625345)
* [2-bedroom house with some outdoor space](http://www.realestate.com.au/property-unit-qld-southport-416835054)
* [2-bed low-rise apartment](http://www.realestate.com.au/property-apartment-qld-southport-404981000)
* [Another 2-bedroom low-rise apartment](http://www.realestate.com.au/property-unit-qld-southport-410505487)

#### Details
No car, but I might get one for the trips up to Brisbane.
I'm okay sharing a bathroom, although an ensuite would be awesome.

I've got my own furniture.

I'd want to move in **mid-late January**. There's some flexibility.


## About you
Hopefully you'll be clean, respectful of others' space and happy to hang out and talk about random stuff occasionally. I like big questions that start with "what if?".

If you just want your space, that's fine too.

I just want someone who'll wash up after they've finished dinner, you know?


## Say hello!

If you're still reading - come say hi! My contact details are at the bottom of the page. I'd love to hear from you.
