There's a library called MathJax which renders LaTeX equations in Javascript. It seems pretty neat, and its site has a long list of sponsors including StackExchange and IEEE.

I'm playing with importing it -- Jekyll's "[front matter][jekyll-frontmatter]" lets you specify variables at the start of a file using [YAML][YAML] syntax, and you can tell the post header to include those variables as scripts. Scripts are stored as files.

Technique came from [this StackOverflow answer][so-answer], and I've modified it to expand the file's contents rather than reference it in a command.

Anyway, the final result -- here is a block of LaTeX from [Kramdown's example][kramdown-math-ex]:

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
