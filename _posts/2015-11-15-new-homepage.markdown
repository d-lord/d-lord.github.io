[Check it out!](http://lord.geek.nz) This is my first web project of any significant merit, and I'm pretty happy with it so far.

It violates a usability rule right now: the nodes look clickable, but aren't.

But hey - it's using an HTML5 canvas, everything scales when you resize the window (with letterboxing!), and it's extensible with other images and nodes.
