It's not much, but I think it's neat.

While practising figure-8s on a Z300 a while back, I ran over a branch mid-corner and had an interesting moment. The idea for this edit has been floating around for a while, so it's good to finally get to it.

Learned a bit about motion tracking, the work area, the trim path effect, and the "wiggle paths" effect.
