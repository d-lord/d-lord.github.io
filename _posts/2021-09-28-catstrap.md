Another project recently tripped and fell into my portfolio at work. It's a little internal webapp which uses Bootstrap 3.

I wanted to play with Bootstrap out of hours, so I can make front-end changes if need be, and inspiration struck. Figured it'd be worth learning v4 to a) see where things are going and b) be prepared to migrate ours if needed in future.

**Anyway, here's [catstrap](https://lord.geek.nz/catstrap).**
